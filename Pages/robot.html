                            The robot that will compete in this year's CRC competition is a simple yet effective design.
                            It is based on a square drivetrain, and a belt and pulley system lifts the game pieces,
                            guided by aluminum extrusion bars, maximizing stability. The gripper can place the game
                            pieces on different stations by rotating around the x-axis, allowing maximum versatility.

                            Once the planning of the robot was done, we moved on to procuring all the
                            components and materials required for the construction phase. This involved careful
                            selection and sourcing of parts, as well as reusing previous projects' pieces.
                            After gathering the necessary supplies, we began the construction process, which
                            involved building and testing the robot, this was mainly done over the holiday break
                            and laid the foundation for the success of our project.

                            A problem during the robot's construction was the team's lack of experience with CAD design
                            software, which has a steep learning curve. Certain parts of the robot required 3D-printed
                            pieces, and it took a lot of time to design them effectively. Many YouTube tutorials and
                            internet guides helped teach the robot team how to use Fusion 360.
