                        Inspired by the theme of JAC and the beanstalk, the kiosk team decided to take
                        inspiration from the land below the clouds in the original story. The whole kiosk is 
                        based around the concept of the little house where Jack lives with his mother and the ever important 
                        cow surrounded by vast woods. Of course, there is also the everpresent beanstalk sprouting in the area.

                        <p>After planning the layout and brainstorming all the ideas that would bring the kiosk to life, it was 
                            finally time to head out on a fairytale adventure to collect the necessary supplies. Once stores where
                            visited and materials were acquired, it was time to start building. Most of the materials from last year's 
                            kiosk were actually reused here to make the walls, benches and table of the new one.
